# Challenge 1: The Perfect Holiday Turkey 🦃

## Your Chefs: Jen Looper, Cloud Advocate (Microsoft) and Darren Butler and Eric Yu, Microsoft Student Ambassadors

## This week's featured region: North America

Here in North America, many families believe that the holidays are simply not complete without a proper turkey on the table. Juicy meat, crispy skin, mouth-watering gravy: a good turkey has it all! The only problem is these birds can be hard to cook so they don't turn out dry and tough. The secret? A proper brine! 

Here's a [sample recipe](https://www.aspicyperspective.com/best-turkey-brine-recipe/) for that important process in the production of a perfect turkey.

There's a science to a great turkey brine, but we, as software engineers, are both absent-minded and need an automated way to remind ourselves each year of the proper percentages of ingredients of a good brine, based on the weight of the turkey.

According to Chef Darren's calculations, the brine equation and roast recommendation looks like this:
### Brine Instructions

- Salt (in cups) = 0.05 * lbs of turkey
- Water (gallons) = 0.66 *  lbs of turkey
- Brown sugar (cups)  = 0.13 * lbs of turkey
- Shallots = 0.2 * lbs of turkey
- Cloves of garlic = 0.4 * lbs of turkey
- Whole peppercorns (tablespoons) = 0.13 * lbs of turkey
- Dried juniper berries (tablespoons) = 0.13 * lbs of turkey
- Fresh rosemary (tablespoons) = 0.13 * lbs of turkey
- Thyme (tablespoons) = 0.06 * lbs of turkey
- Brine time (in hours) = 2.4 * lbs of turkey
- Roast time (in minutes) = 15 * lbs of turkey

## Your challenge 🍽 

Convert this brine equation and cook time to an automated process so that when you input a turkey's weight, you will be given the amount of water, sugar, salt, and spices to add and a recommendation on how long to cook it.

Let's assume you have available a large cooler for your turkey and its brine and that it's defrosted.
