# Challenge 3: The Longest Kebab

## Your Chefs: Cecil Phillip, Cloud Advocate (Microsoft) with Baris Ceviz, Microsoft Student Ambassador 

## This week's featured region: Turkey

`Adana kebabı` or 'kebab' is a traditional meal, eaten in many religious and national holidays in Turkey. "It's a long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled on an open `mangal` or grill filled with burning charcoal. The culinary item is named after Adana, the fifth largest city of Turkey" [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana_kebab%C4%B1). In the city of Adana, festivals are held with a competition centered around who can make the longest kebab in the world. At the festival, people have fun and eat this delicious dish!

## Your challenge 🍽 

The most common problem in this festival is calculating how much material is needed to create the longest possible kebab based on the amount of material you have on hand. Since there are so many people at the festival, and you'd like to serve them all, the materials must be calculated quickly.

You need to produce a fast serverless solution to this problem. Create a **kebab calculator** that, given a certain amount of meat in kilos, can calculate how many people you'll be able to feed as well as how long your kebab can be!

Keep in mind that kebabs aren't only made of meat! Here's a [recipe](https://www.thespruceeats.com/adana-kebab-4164647) that you can work with:

- 2 kilos ground lamb
- 1 small onion (minced)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin (divided)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground sumac (divided)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

With your fast calculator, you might be able to win the prize for the longest kebab!
