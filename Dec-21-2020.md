# Challenge 5: Tteok-guk for The New Year

## Your Chefs: Justin Yoo (Cloud Advocate, Microsoft) and You Jin Kim, Hong Min Kim and Aaron Roh (Microsoft Student Ambassadors)
## This week's featured region: Korea

In Korea, when New Year begins, everyone eats tteok-guk (rice cake soup). There are various shapes of tteok, but especially for greeting New Year, garae-tteok is the most popular to make the soup.

As garae-tteok has a long and cylindrical shape, people wish to live long, by eating tteok-guk. When cooking tteok-guk, the garae-tteok is sliced into small pieces, which look like coins. This coin-like shape is believed to bring wealth.

## Your challenge üçΩ 

This recipe calls for several steps, and we want to create an automated process to set reminders for each step. For example, if you buy the sliced garae-tteok, you should wait for 30 mins for them to soak. Make sure that the stir-fried beef goes brown in 8 mins but it may take longer than that! And don't let anything burn!
