# Welcome to the Seasons of Serverless!

Mes chers amis,

Every year, we all look forward to our annual holiday potluck. From jollof rice all across West Africa to Indian ladoos to celebrate Diwali, sharing our favorite foods and traditions is our favorite part of the season!

Of course, we know that's not possible this year, so we've come up with an alternative: a virtual code challenge potluck! Each week, someone in our community is going to post a unique code challenge exploring a recipe and a food for all of our friends to solve. It may not be the same as breaking bread in-person or smelling and tasting your flavorful creations, but hopefully these delectable brain-teasers can still give us a taste of each other's traditions.

Grosses bises, Dominique et Simone

## Challenge 4: A Big BBQ!

**Featured Region: LATAM/Brazil**

**Your Chefs: Lucas Santos, Cloud Advocate (Microsoft) with Rogerio Rodrigues and Sydney Cirqueira, Microsoft Student Ambassadors**

In Brazil, everyone loves a big barbecue! Brazilian barbecue is justifiably famous. Some families have created whole systems to help organize the amount of food needed for the number of people invited to a big barbecue. We have gained access to a spreadsheet used to organize large family barbecues: [here it is](graphics/bbq-spreadsheet.xlsx). Big events like this can get expensive, and you need to stay in within your budget. Your challenge? Using the percentages in the spreadsheet, create a serverless method of determining how many people you can invite based on a given budget. [Learn more about this challenge](Dec-14-2020.md).
